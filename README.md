# Using PDFPlumber for PDF data extraction

https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber

PDFPlumber is a python tool for extracting data, including table formatted data from PDF files. It also provides visual debugging of the extraction process, unlike many other similar tools.

  - Simple to parse data
  - Table extraction
  - Available in pip
  - VISUAL DEBUGGING!

# Installation
'''
pip install pdfplumber
'''
For visual debugging, ImageMagick also needs to be installed as described on the PDFPlumber page above.

# Visual Debugging

PDFPlumber allows you visually inspect how the parser sees the documents to refine your optimization.
'''
page = pdf.pages[0]
img = page.to_image()
img.draw_rects(page.extract_words())

# Data Extraction Example

For this example data is extracted for an actual project from radio dispatch reports which were provided in PDF form.

For this sample, there wasn't a lot of overly complex formatted data, so the needed data could be found by examining the lines of text extracted from the file.

'''
all_evts = {}
for counter, event in tqdm(enumerate(events[:])):
    evt = {}
    for line in event:
        line = line.strip()

        # --- removed for brevity ---

        match = re.match(r'(Nature:)(.*)(Alarm Lvl:)(.*)(Priority:)(.*)(Event Priority:)(.*)$', line)
        if match:
            evt['nature'] = match.group(2).strip()
            evt['alarm_level'] = match.group(4).strip()

        all_evts[counter] = evt

The extracted lines could then be parsed using python's excellent regex support to isolate the needed data.

'''
with open('cad.json', 'w') as outfile:
    json.dump(all_evts, outfile)
'''
And export the data for use as a JSON file.
